# brick ðŸ§±

`brick` is a tool used to build and deploy monorepos, and is internally used at [Tomorrow](https://www.tmrow.com).
It uses docker (buildkit) as the build engine.

## Installation

Make sure you have docker installed, and then run:

```
python3 setup.py install
```

## Development

```
pip3 install -e .
```

This will create a symlink so you can develop and use the `brick` command globally.

A few other useful commands using a virtual environment:

    make .venv      # setup virtual environment
    make clean      # removes any generated files
    make lint       # lints using Pylint
    make typecheck  # mypy typechecking
    make test       # run py.test
    make format     # formats using Black

    make verify     # runs all the above

## Usage

First, create an empty WORKSPACE file at the root of your repo:

```
touch WORKSPACE
```

Then, for each folder that you'd like to build/deploy, you can create a BUILD.yaml file that describes the dependencies and the build/deploy steps.
Each step is cached and will only re-run if the commands change, or if the input change.
`brick` automatically detects dependencies by searching for inputs intersecting outputs of another build, and triggers the apprioriate build dependencies as needed.

This is an example of the configuration used to build the Tomorrow website to Github Pages:

```yaml
name: www

steps:
  prepare:
    image: node:10.3 # This is a docker image that will be used (optional)
    commands:
      - yarn
    inputs:
      - package.json
      - yarn.lock

  build:
    commands:
      - yarn lint
      - yarn build
    inputs:
      - static
      - src
      - gatsby-*.js
      - .eslintrc.js
    outputs:
      - public

  deploy:
    commands:
      - mkdir -p -m 0700 ~/.ssh && ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
      - --mount=type=ssh git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:tmrowco/tmrowapp.git -b gh-pages
      - rm -rf ./tmrowapp/* && cp -r ../www/public/* ./tmrowapp
      - echo 'www.tmrow.com' > tmrowapp/CNAME
      - cd tmrowapp &&
        git config user.name "brick" &&
        git config user.email "brick@tmrow.com" &&
        git add . &&
        git commit -m "deploy" --allow-empty &&
        git push
    pass_ssh: True
```

Note the deployment will only be triggered if any file declared as inputs changes, or if the deployment commands change.

## Commands

```
Usage: brick [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --verbose               verbose
  -r, --recursive         recursive
  --skip-previous-steps   skips previous steps (helpful if the prev. steps are running separately)
  --help                  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build
  deploy
  develop
  prepare
  prune
  test
```

## Known Issues

- **`brick build` doesn't provide full Docker steps output** - this issue might appear for some versions of Docker but it shouldn't be there on the version `19.03.4` (see [#35](https://github.com/tmrowco/brick/issues/35) for more context); the ultimate cause might be a bug with [docker-py](https://github.com/docker/docker-py)
